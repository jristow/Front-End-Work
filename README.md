# Front End Work

A small portfolio showcasing select front end work that I have worked on.

To properly view the data visualization front end you will need to run it on an http server.

Node's http-server is recommended.

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Then from the data visualization working directory:

```
http-server &
```
